# BookEdu

A simple web-enabled software (application) to enter/track books by author, by genre. The application will store author information (last 
name, first name), genre (for example si-fi, fiction, etc), book title, ISBN, publisher. Obviously, there is a one to many relation 
between an author and a book. The application should have feature to enter a new author, a new title. The user should be able to search 
existing books by author, by title. Also, in addition to data bound pages, application should have main (home) page, and about page (to 
show the version, the authors of the application.) You need to use some RDBMS product to store information (MS Access, SQL Server, or
Oracle) whichever your team prefers. As for the application screens/pages, you can use any development IDE (Visual Studio, Eclipse, 
NetBeans, etc ), technology (.NET, JAVA) and programming language.
